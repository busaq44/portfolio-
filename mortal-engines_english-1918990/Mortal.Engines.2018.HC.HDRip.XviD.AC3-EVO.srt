<i>60 minutes is all it took</i>

3
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:28,236
<i>for the Ancients

4
00:00:28,238 --> 00:00:32,841
<i>to the brink of extinction.</i>

5
00:00:32,843 --> 00:00:36,912
<i>Those who survived
mobilized their settlements</i>

6
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:42,152
<i>to begin life anew

7
00:00:44,121 --> 00:00:50,024
<i>In the hunt for food and fuel,
the weak perished,</i>

8
00:00:50,026 --> 00:00:55,330
<i>and the strong grew

00:00:55,332 --> 00:01:00,134

Predator Cities of the West.</i>

<i>Vestin Al-Ga Gustanee.</i>

00:01:58,428 --> 00:02:01,096
<i>Osh alga. Aye. Osh alga.</i>

00:02:10,807 --> 00:02:13,377
<i>Osh alga kasht du mara Khazak.</i>

15
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,882
Predator! Predator city!

16
00:02:20,884 --> 00:02:23,285
Six miles and closing!

17
00:02:27,757 --> 00:02:28,991
Leave it behind! Let's go!

18
00:02:28,993 --> 00:02:29,960
Leaving!

19
00:02:45,942 --> 00:02:48,777
Hurry! Fire up the engines!

20
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:51,249
Move it, Dietrich!
Fire them up!

21
00:02:52,716 --> 00:02:54,183
Crank all engines.

22
00:02:54,185 --> 00:02:57,052
- Come on! Come on!
- Engine one is down!

23
00:02:57,054 --> 00:02:59,220
Switch to auxiliaries.

24
00:02:59,222 --> 00:03:01,859
Hurry! Hurry!

25
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,125
- Start them up!
- Full throttle!

26
00:03:37,127 --> 00:03:39,327
<i>Yew sahk!</i>

27
00:04:07,924 --> 00:04:09,924
Full power.

28
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,046
London!

29
00:04:43,561 --> 00:04:46,328
Five, six...

30
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,595
Lord Mayor on deck.

31
00:04:47,597 --> 00:04:49,564
- Lord Mayor.
- Mr. Valentine.

32
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:52,968
- What have we got?
- Small Bavarian mining town,

33
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,102
powered by C-20 land engines.

34
00:04:55,104 --> 00:04:57,004
Usual store of brick,
coal and iron.

35
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:59,442
And 75 tons of salt.

36
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:02,044
Barely enough fuel
to last us a week.

37
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:03,912
We've left the safety
of Britain,

38
00:05:03,914 --> 00:05:05,948
we've crossed the land bridge,
for what?

39
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,218
To feed upon the scraps
of Europe.

40
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,352
- Run it down.
- Aye, aye, sir.

41
00:05:34,277 --> 00:05:36,011
They're gaining on us.

42
00:05:36,013 --> 00:05:38,247
Empty the silos.

43
00:05:38,249 --> 00:05:39,648
All of them.

44
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,648
Do it!

45
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,884
Get down there!

46
00:06:13,684 --> 00:06:15,516
It's madness out there.

47
00:06:15,518 --> 00:06:17,619
You'd think they've never
seen a chase before.

48
00:06:17,621 --> 00:06:20,155
Well, it has been a while, sir.

49
00:06:20,157 --> 00:06:22,023
- Morning, Clytie.
- Morning, Dr. Pomeroy.

50
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:25,927
The news is not good
from the Hall of Ceramics.

51
00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:28,297
I'm afraid we've suffered
some casualties.

52
00:06:28,299 --> 00:06:30,264
Damn these bloody vibrations.

53
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:31,967
- Oh.
- Steady on, Arkie.

54
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:34,302
No, no, no, no,
d-don't worry about me.

55
00:06:34,304 --> 00:06:36,506
We're about to lose
our American deities.

56
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,479
Excuse me, Dr. Pomeroy?

57
00:06:44,047 --> 00:06:45,713
Good morning, Miss Valentine.

58
00:06:45,715 --> 00:06:47,448
I've been waiting outside
the Manuscripts Room

59
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,984
for quite some time.

60
00:06:48,986 --> 00:06:50,718
Your 9:00?

61
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,155
I do apologize.

62
00:06:53,157 --> 00:06:55,323
This is not good enough.

63
00:06:55,325 --> 00:06:57,225
Where the hell is Tom?

64
00:06:57,227 --> 00:06:58,559
- Coming through!
- London! London!

65
00:06:58,561 --> 00:07:00,095
Watch yourself!

66
00:07:00,097 --> 00:07:01,963
- Whoa!
- Watch it!

67
00:07:01,965 --> 00:07:03,030
Whoa!

68
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:09,571
Sorry. Sorry.

69
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:11,605
London! London! London!

70
00:07:27,491 --> 00:07:29,360
Give me everything you have.

71
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:39,134
They're heading
for the foothills.

72
00:07:39,136 --> 00:07:41,268
- Stay on course.
- Sir?

73
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,941
Stay on course.

74
00:08:14,138 --> 00:08:15,472
Take the shot.

75
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,345
Incoming!

76
00:08:33,724 --> 00:08:35,759
Yes! Yes!

77
00:08:37,628 --> 00:08:39,394
Well done, everyone.

78
00:08:39,396 --> 00:08:41,396
- Prepare to ingest.
- Aye, aye, sir.

79
00:09:24,407 --> 00:09:27,675
Ah, Mr. Natsworthy.
Nice of you to join us.

80
00:09:27,677 --> 00:09:29,578
I'm so sorry I'm late, sir.

81
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,512
You look nice.
Have you had a haircut?

82
00:09:31,514 --> 00:09:32,848
- I don't want to hear it, Tom.
- Is that new cologne?

83
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,716
You're already
on your third warning.

84
00:09:34,718 --> 00:09:36,354
This is your last.

85
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,288
Citizens of Salzhaken,

86
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,156
welcome to London.

87
00:09:42,158 --> 00:09:45,193
Bring only your personal
possessions with you.

88
00:09:45,195 --> 00:09:49,330
Old tech is to be deposited
in the bins provided.

89
00:09:49,332 --> 00:09:53,901
Citizens of Salzhaken,
welcome to London.

90
00:09:53,903 --> 00:09:55,569
All right, then. Follow me.

91
00:09:55,571 --> 00:09:58,439
So, you're studying
the end of the Ancients?

92
00:09:58,441 --> 00:10:00,375
What I really need
are firsthand accounts

93
00:10:00,377 --> 00:10:01,742
of the Sixty Minute War.

94
00:10:01,744 --> 00:10:04,445
Journals, books,
personal papers.

95
00:10:04,447 --> 00:10:08,549
Very few written records
survived during that period.

96
00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:10,251
It may very well be they forgot

97
00:10:10,253 --> 00:10:11,620
how to read
and write altogether.

98
00:10:11,622 --> 00:10:14,588
But if it's the
Sixty Minute War you're after,

99
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,726
follow me.

100
00:10:18,295 --> 00:10:20,131
Just give us a minute.

101
00:10:22,298 --> 00:10:26,568
Strange to think
this is what it looked like.

102
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,770
21st century? Yep.

103
00:10:28,772 --> 00:10:31,305
It's so different.

104
00:10:31,307 --> 00:10:33,275
Yeah, well, that's what happens
when the Earth's crust

105
00:10:33,277 --> 00:10:35,479
gets shattered
into a thousand pieces.

106
00:10:36,812 --> 00:10:38,479
Check this out.

107
00:10:38,481 --> 00:10:39,881
- Did you make this?
- Yeah.

108
00:10:39,883 --> 00:10:41,949
Bits of old scrap tech I found.

109
00:10:41,951 --> 00:10:45,819
The power system was a little
bit tricky, but luckily,

110
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:48,656
I got my man Matthew there
limbered up and ready to go.

111
00:10:53,564 --> 00:10:55,833
This is what I wanted
to show you.

112
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:04,242
It's a quantum energy weapon.

113
00:11:05,742 --> 00:11:08,543
There were dozens of them
all over the globe.

114
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:09,910
My God.

115
00:11:09,912 --> 00:11:12,646
They called it Medusa.

116
00:11:12,648 --> 00:11:16,383
How can a society so advanced,
so scientific, be so stupid?

117
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:17,852
Well, no more stupid
than people today.

118
00:11:17,854 --> 00:11:19,853
They just had far worse weapons

119
00:11:19,855 --> 00:11:23,992
and far more sophisticated
control systems.

120
00:11:23,994 --> 00:11:25,727
What a nightmare.

121
00:11:25,729 --> 00:11:27,862
Well, the Ancients
felt the same way.

122
00:11:27,864 --> 00:11:31,366
That's why they created
this little fella.

123
00:11:31,368 --> 00:11:32,968
A crash drive
to shut down the weapon.

124
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,669
Doesn't this stuff
creep you out?

125
00:11:34,671 --> 00:11:36,438
Let me tell you something.

126
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,640
We come across dangerous tech

127
00:11:38,642 --> 00:11:41,811
that's in way better condition
than this junk all the time.

128
00:11:43,714 --> 00:11:46,448
Now, I've noticed that pieces
have started to go missing.

129
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,782
I notified my boss,
who notified his boss,

130
00:11:48,784 --> 00:11:50,484
and of course nothing happened,

131
00:11:50,486 --> 00:11:55,392
so I decided to take
a few precautions of my own.

132
00:11:59,763 --> 00:12:03,265
All of it is viable
weapons-grade tech.

133
00:12:04,734 --> 00:12:07,468
- God help us.
- The next time we cross

134
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,838
the marshlands, I'm tossing
the entire bloody lot

135
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,040
over the side.

136
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:14,409
Just let it sink
to the bottom of a swamp

137
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:16,414
where no one will ever find it.

138
00:12:22,686 --> 00:12:25,286
Miss Valentine. You should have
told me you were coming.

139
00:12:25,288 --> 00:12:26,954
I would have laid
something on for you.

140
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:29,491
Hello, Herbert.

141
00:12:29,493 --> 00:12:31,593
What are you still
doing here, Natsworthy?

142
00:12:31,595 --> 00:12:32,861
You're on gut duty.

143
00:12:32,863 --> 00:12:35,463
No, I'm assisting
Miss Valentine.

144
00:12:35,465 --> 00:12:37,464
Not anymore.

145
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,333
- You've been demoted.
- What?

146
00:12:39,335 --> 00:12:41,636
- Uh, by who?
- By me.

147
00:12:41,638 --> 00:12:44,372
You're just a skivvy
from the lower tiers

148
00:12:44,374 --> 00:12:46,708
with no family
and no prospects.

149
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,775
If those dim-witted
spanner-heads

150
00:12:47,777 --> 00:12:49,310
beat you to the bins again,

151
00:12:49,312 --> 00:12:51,011
you'll be back
to cleaning the bogs.

152
00:12:51,013 --> 00:12:53,615
Chop-chop.

153
00:12:53,617 --> 00:12:55,684
Well, it's been lovely
chatting.

154
00:12:55,686 --> 00:12:57,254
I have to go.

155
00:12:58,788 --> 00:13:01,292
It's rush hour.
He'll never make it.

156
00:13:02,526 --> 00:13:04,559
Wait! Tom!

157
00:13:06,729 --> 00:13:08,997
Tom, wait!

158
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:11,333
- I can get you down there.
- You what?

159
00:13:11,335 --> 00:13:13,101
I can get you down there.

160
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,106
Citizens of Salzhaken,

161
00:13:18,108 --> 00:13:19,573
welcome to London.

162
00:13:19,575 --> 00:13:21,108
Bring only your

163
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,078
personal possessions with you.

164
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,751
Old tech is to be deposited
in the bins provided.

165
00:13:34,957 --> 00:13:36,526
- -Uh...

166
00:13:38,061 --> 00:13:39,928
- Okay.
- Hey.

167
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,496
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

168
00:13:41,498 --> 00:13:42,830
I'm with her.

169
00:13:42,832 --> 00:13:44,031
I don't know, I'm with her.

170
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:45,500
- Come on through.
- Really?

171
00:13:45,502 --> 00:13:46,700
On you go.

172
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:48,636
Sorry about that.

173
00:13:48,638 --> 00:13:50,505
And that's it? We're through?

174
00:13:50,507 --> 00:13:52,873
Just like that.

175
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,977
Stay in your allocated line.

176
00:13:55,979 --> 00:14:00,147
Possession of any form of
weapon is strictly prohibited.

177
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:01,982
Hold up, hold up.
What's this, then?

178
00:14:01,984 --> 00:14:03,450
- We'll have that.
- Incomers failing to follow instructions

179
00:14:03,452 --> 00:14:04,888
will be detained.

180
00:14:15,665 --> 00:14:17,431
So, what's the rush?

181
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:19,434
Well, got to get down there

182
00:14:19,436 --> 00:14:21,902
and go through all the
artifacts taken off the catch.

183
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:24,506
And anything of historical
importance goes to the museum.

184
00:14:24,508 --> 00:14:27,107
But if I'm late,
the gut workers

185
00:14:27,109 --> 00:14:29,577
shovel everything
into the furnaces.

186
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:31,949
All they care about
is feeding the beast.

187
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:39,920
...failing
to follow instructions

188
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:41,055
- will be detained.
- No, no weapons allowed.

189
00:14:41,057 --> 00:14:43,657
- You cannot treat us like this!
- You stupid? No weapons.

190
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:45,959
...must be
presented for inspection.

191
00:14:45,961 --> 00:14:47,929
Be aware, children may be

192
00:14:47,931 --> 00:14:50,835
temporarily separated
from parents.

193
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,737
Nether Borough Station.

194
00:14:55,739 --> 00:14:58,106
Disembark here
for Digestion Yards,

195
00:14:58,108 --> 00:15:01,876
Incomer Processing
and Main Engine Rooms.

196
00:15:01,878 --> 00:15:03,578
Mind the drop.

197
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,679
They still haven't caught her?

198
00:15:04,681 --> 00:15:06,113
Who, Anna Fang?

199
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:07,748
Yeah.

200
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,583
Bloody Anti-Tractionist.

201
00:15:09,585 --> 00:15:11,586
Should be locked up,
in my opinion.

202
00:15:11,588 --> 00:15:12,987
Next one. Move it.

203
00:15:12,989 --> 00:15:15,957
What about you, eh?
What are you hiding?

204
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:17,525
Yeah, all right. Go through.

205
00:15:17,527 --> 00:15:19,059
Next.

206
00:15:19,061 --> 00:15:20,929
- You there.
- Incomers failing

207
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:23,997
to follow instructions
will be detained.

208
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:27,035
All belongings must be
presented for inspection.

209
00:15:27,037 --> 00:15:28,569
We're the enemy.

210
00:15:28,571 --> 00:15:29,938
Anti-Tractionists loathe
everything we stand for.

211
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,673
Yeah, what, like progress?

212
00:15:31,675 --> 00:15:32,607
But it's not progress,
not to them.

213
00:15:32,609 --> 00:15:35,108
To them, our way of life
is unsustainable.

214
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,178
- They see Tractionism as a...
- Oh, oh!

215
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,646
Careful.

216
00:15:38,648 --> 00:15:40,781
Oh, Bevis, mate.

217
00:15:40,783 --> 00:15:42,720
Your tools
are all over the floor.

218
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:46,954
I'm so sorry.

219
00:15:46,956 --> 00:15:49,022
You all right, Tom?

220
00:15:49,024 --> 00:15:50,824
- On bins again?
- Yeah.

221
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:53,660
- What are you doing down here?
- Waste chute maintenance.

222
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:55,128
I got it. Just leave it.

223
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,897
I really am sorry.
I didn't see you.

224
00:15:56,899 --> 00:15:57,867
Why would you?

225
00:16:00,135 --> 00:16:02,102
Bevis, this is Katherine...

226
00:16:02,104 --> 00:16:03,941
Yeah, I know who she is.
Catch you later.

227
00:16:08,277 --> 00:16:10,911
No, no, no, you don't!

228
00:16:10,913 --> 00:16:12,981
Stop! Oh, no, no, no.

229
00:16:12,983 --> 00:16:15,516
Stop! Stop!

230
00:16:15,518 --> 00:16:17,584
That is a Sunbeam TA200.

231
00:16:17,586 --> 00:16:20,021
That's a classic
Radiant Control

232
00:16:20,023 --> 00:16:23,591
double-slice toaster
with automatic bread ejection.

233
00:16:23,593 --> 00:16:25,626
All right? We have to...

234
00:16:25,628 --> 00:16:28,029
And you've lost the knob.

235
00:16:28,031 --> 00:16:30,665
Oh, for Quirke's sake.

236
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:33,668
Someone knows
their small appliances.

237
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,939
Here.

238
00:16:36,071 --> 00:16:37,738
Very, very nice.

239
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,973
I've dug up a few of these
in my time,

240
00:16:39,975 --> 00:16:41,876
but none as good as this.

241
00:16:41,878 --> 00:16:44,878
Couple of small dents,
a little bit of tarnishing.

242
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,915
Springs gone,
but they always are.

243
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:48,750
Yeah, well...

244
00:16:48,752 --> 00:16:50,318
That is far better
than anything

245
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,719
in the museum's
current collection.

246
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,155
Well done.

247
00:16:54,157 --> 00:16:56,156
That's high praise
coming from you, sir.

248
00:16:56,158 --> 00:16:59,126
You know, I-I just want to say,
I-I've read all your books.

249
00:16:59,128 --> 00:17:00,328
- Oh, don't encourage him.
- I...

250
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,230
His head's quite big enough.

251
00:17:02,232 --> 00:17:04,933
Hi, Dad.

252
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,808
Kate, what are you doing here?

253
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,976
- I thought you were going to the museum.
- I did.

254
00:17:15,978 --> 00:17:17,146
That's where I bumped into Tom.

255
00:17:18,948 --> 00:17:20,817
Tom.

256
00:17:21,984 --> 00:17:23,651
Tom Natsworthy, isn't it?

257
00:17:23,653 --> 00:17:25,653
Yes, it is.

258
00:17:25,655 --> 00:17:27,288
I knew your parents.

259
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,856
They were lovely people.

260
00:17:28,858 --> 00:17:31,224
- First-class historians, both.
- Excuse me.

261
00:17:31,226 --> 00:17:34,261
I thought you had plans
to be an aviator.

262
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:37,632
Oh, yeah, I was,
but then I gave it all up.

263
00:17:37,634 --> 00:17:41,168
I mean, history's
more my thing, sir.

264
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,337
I'm surprised they called you

265
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:43,838
down here
for such a small catch.

266
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,807
Don't underestimate
what's buried

267
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:47,107
out there in the salt flats.

268
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:49,010
These... these mining towns
have a way

269
00:17:49,012 --> 00:17:50,848
of digging up
really interesting...

270
00:17:52,314 --> 00:17:53,816
...old tech.

271
00:17:54,984 --> 00:17:57,821
- No way.
- What is that?

272
00:17:58,888 --> 00:18:02,757
That is a fusion inverter cell.

273
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:05,193
Incredibly rare
and really dangerous.

274
00:18:05,195 --> 00:18:07,828
And you know the Guild of
Engineers nicked all the ones

275
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,130
we had in store at the museum
just a few months ago?

276
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:11,765
Pomeroy was furious.

277
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:13,667
Well, they won't get
their hands on this one.

278
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:15,802
I'll make sure
it's disposed of properly.

279
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:18,405
Engineers, eh?
They think they run the place.

280
00:18:18,407 --> 00:18:20,875
They don't know
what they're playing with.

281
00:18:20,877 --> 00:18:22,946
- Fire.
- Sorry?

282
00:18:24,147 --> 00:18:27,083
They're playing with fire.

283
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:32,419
I said get your hands off!

284
00:18:32,421 --> 00:18:33,754
Never!

285
00:18:37,092 --> 00:18:38,925
Oi!

286
00:18:38,927 --> 00:18:40,194
What's going on?

287
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:44,033
Take this gentleman
to the medics.

288
00:18:45,201 --> 00:18:47,769
I want that man on a charge.

289
00:18:47,771 --> 00:18:49,302
Move it.

290
00:18:49,304 --> 00:18:51,338
That should never have
happened; you all deserve

291
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,241
to be treated
with dignity and respect.

292
00:18:53,243 --> 00:18:55,209
You will be given food,

293
00:18:55,211 --> 00:18:57,377
shelter and employment.

294
00:18:57,379 --> 00:18:58,846
A chance to build a future,

295
00:18:58,848 --> 00:19:01,351
make a new life.

296
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:06,823
Hey! Watch out!

297
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,127
Valentine.

298
00:19:12,896 --> 00:19:15,396
This is for my mother.

299
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:20,134
This is for Pandora Shaw.

300
00:19:21,771 --> 00:19:22,740
Dad!

301
00:19:29,812 --> 00:19:30,944
No!

302
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,196
- There!
- Come on.

303
00:19:49,198 --> 00:19:51,299
- Down here!
- Hey, you!

304
00:19:52,801 --> 00:19:54,068
No! Stop her!

305
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:57,405
Hey, come back here! Stop!

306
00:19:57,407 --> 00:19:58,940
Get out of the way!

307
00:20:06,182 --> 00:20:08,081
Dad!

308
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,119
Stay here.

309
00:21:12,381 --> 00:21:14,182
No! No!

310
00:21:14,184 --> 00:21:15,953
Wait!

311
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:21,955
Come on!

312
00:21:21,957 --> 00:21:23,392
Come on!

313
00:22:05,435 --> 00:22:08,135
No!

314
00:22:08,137 --> 00:22:09,502
I've got you.

315
00:22:09,504 --> 00:22:11,638
Let go of me!

316
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,307
Tom!

317
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:15,376
Tom?

318
00:22:15,378 --> 00:22:17,979
Look at me. Look at me.

319
00:22:17,981 --> 00:22:20,450
This is what he does
when you get in his way.

320
00:22:22,318 --> 00:22:24,253
Ask him why
he murdered my mother.

321
00:22:26,222 --> 00:22:28,392
Ask him about Hester Shaw.

322
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,362
No. No!

323
00:22:45,108 --> 00:22:48,512
I-I tried.
I-I tried to stop her.

324
00:22:50,946 --> 00:22:52,280
It's not your fault.

325
00:22:52,282 --> 00:22:54,115
She was saying
the craziest things,

326
00:22:54,117 --> 00:22:57,350
- and then she just...
- What did she say?

327
00:22:57,352 --> 00:22:59,119
- You-you need a doctor.
- No, no.

328
00:22:59,121 --> 00:23:01,225
What did she say, Tom?

329
00:23:03,025 --> 00:23:06,629
She said you murdered
her mother.

330
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,964
Murder?

331
00:23:10,966 --> 00:23:13,934
That's an ugly word.

332
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:17,504
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

333
00:23:17,506 --> 00:23:19,507
Yeah.

334
00:23:19,509 --> 00:23:22,475
Well, I should go.

335
00:23:22,477 --> 00:23:25,349
Yeah, you should.

336
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,459
Dad!

337
00:23:40,062 --> 00:23:42,262
Dad.

338
00:23:42,264 --> 00:23:45,332
It's all right. It's all right.
I'm okay. I'll be okay.

339
00:23:45,334 --> 00:23:46,969
I'll be okay.

340
00:23:48,538 --> 00:23:51,504
Kate, I'm sorry.
There was nothing I could do.

341
00:23:51,506 --> 00:23:53,540
What do you mean?

342
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:55,742
They were fighting,
Tom and the girl.

343
00:23:55,744 --> 00:23:58,282
The railing broke.

344
00:23:59,415 --> 00:24:01,018
Coming through!

345
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,408
I'm sorry about Tom.

346
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,179
I really am.

347
00:24:32,247 --> 00:24:35,383
We have airships
out there looking.

348
00:24:35,385 --> 00:24:37,654
If he's alive, we'll find him.

349
00:24:41,157 --> 00:24:43,190
- What is it?
- The girl.

350
00:24:43,192 --> 00:24:45,091
Who was she?

351
00:24:45,093 --> 00:24:47,228
Honestly, I don't know.

352
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,797
Been wondering
about that myself.

353
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,464
She knew you.

354
00:24:51,466 --> 00:24:53,666
I've never seen her
in my life before.

355
00:24:53,668 --> 00:24:56,636
I thought maybe she was
an Anti-Tractionist.

356
00:24:56,638 --> 00:24:59,309
God knows they hate us enough.

357
00:25:00,609 --> 00:25:02,576
I know you want to believe

358
00:25:02,578 --> 00:25:04,677
that Traction Cities
and static settlements

359
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:07,580
can live together in peace,
but it'll never happen.

360
00:25:07,582 --> 00:25:10,417
- You don't know that.
- Then why do they hide

361
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:12,685
behind the Shield Wall,
hoarding their resources?

362
00:25:12,687 --> 00:25:15,623
They mean to see us
starve out here, Kate.

363
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:18,261
Never underestimate
their will to destroy us.

364
00:25:20,329 --> 00:25:23,300
There will never be peace
with Shan Guo.

365
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:42,718
This is ruined.
I'll get rid of it.

366
00:26:37,506 --> 00:26:39,173
Ow, my head.

367
00:26:43,879 --> 00:26:44,912
What?

368
00:26:59,195 --> 00:27:00,293
Wait.

369
00:27:01,664 --> 00:27:03,600
What's going on?

370
00:27:05,534 --> 00:27:08,536
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hang on, hang on.

371
00:27:08,538 --> 00:27:10,803
You see, you-you can't
just leave me here.

372
00:27:10,805 --> 00:27:12,473
You shouldn't have followed me.

373
00:27:12,475 --> 00:27:13,840
I didn't follow you.

374
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:15,244
I fell.

375
00:27:16,846 --> 00:27:18,748
He pushed me.

376
00:27:20,683 --> 00:27:22,616
Hey.

377
00:27:22,618 --> 00:27:24,184
Wait.

378
00:27:25,454 --> 00:27:27,922
Oh, for Quirke's sake.

379
00:27:27,924 --> 00:27:29,392
Oi.

380
00:27:30,493 --> 00:27:31,925
I'm talking to you.

381
00:27:31,927 --> 00:27:33,626
Hello?

382
00:27:33,628 --> 00:27:35,495
What am I supposed to do, eh?

383
00:27:35,497 --> 00:27:37,298
Where am I supposed to go?

384
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,232
- I need to get back on London.
- Six months!

385
00:27:39,234 --> 00:27:41,702
- Just take it easy.
- Six months it took me to get on that city.

386
00:27:41,704 --> 00:27:45,673
I had one shot at Valentine,
and you ruined it.

387
00:27:45,675 --> 00:27:48,278
Okay. All right. All right.

388
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,415
I have money.

389
00:27:55,417 --> 00:27:56,887
No, you don't.

390
00:28:01,256 --> 00:28:02,589
Please.

391
00:28:02,591 --> 00:28:04,591
Please help me get back
on London.

392
00:28:04,593 --> 00:28:07,563
Help me find a trading town.
You'll never see me again.

393
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,635
We're running low
on food, fuel, basic resources.

394
00:28:14,637 --> 00:28:17,637
We can't survive out here
much longer.

395
00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:19,673
We should never have gone
into Europe.

396
00:28:19,675 --> 00:28:21,407
Biggest mistake we ever made.

397
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:23,676
Well, we have other options.

398
00:28:23,678 --> 00:28:27,880
Ah, yes. Your long-awaited
energy project.

399
00:28:27,882 --> 00:28:30,350
- It'll work.
- I've heard that before.

400
00:28:30,352 --> 00:28:32,720
I just need a little more time.

401
00:28:32,722 --> 00:28:34,621
Always so sure of yourself.

402
00:28:34,623 --> 00:28:38,992
Thaddeus Valentine,
the great archaeologist.

403
00:28:38,994 --> 00:28:40,661
Man of the people.

404
00:28:40,663 --> 00:28:42,930
One of the reasons
I took you in,

405
00:28:42,932 --> 00:28:45,499
why I allowed an outsider
from nowhere

406
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:48,368
to have power
above his station.

407
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:51,704
But my patience
is wearing thin.

408
00:28:51,706 --> 00:28:53,906
I raised you up.

409
00:28:53,908 --> 00:28:56,777
I can tear you down.

410
00:28:59,314 --> 00:29:01,581
How can you stand him?

411
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:03,519
He's afraid.

412
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,954
He's trying to hang on
to a way of life

413
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:09,623
that doesn't exist anymore.

414
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:12,592
Municipal Darwinism.

415
00:29:12,594 --> 00:29:14,662
It's a dying system.

416
00:29:14,664 --> 00:29:16,463
Prey has all but gone.

417
00:29:16,465 --> 00:29:18,464
Soon, there'll be nothing left.

418
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:20,634
I'm trying to build
this city a future,

419
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:24,370
but Crome's stuck in the past.

420
00:29:24,372 --> 00:29:25,905
Where are you going?

421
00:29:25,907 --> 00:29:27,907
Dad, you can't go to work.

422
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:29,475
I'm fine, Kate.

423
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:31,511
You're not fine.
You're injured.

424
00:29:31,513 --> 00:29:33,079
You need to rest.

425
00:29:33,081 --> 00:29:36,082
I've spent 15 years
developing this power system.

426
00:29:36,084 --> 00:29:39,919
I'm not having Magnus Crome
or Hester Shaw stop me now.

427
00:29:39,921 --> 00:29:41,790
Who's Hester Shaw?

428
00:29:44,926 --> 00:29:46,463
No one.

429
00:29:47,596 --> 00:29:49,965
No one you know.

430
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:00,741
Could you slow down, please?

431
00:30:00,743 --> 00:30:02,742
You want to find
a trading town?

432
00:30:02,744 --> 00:30:05,011
Keep moving.

433
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:07,481
- My feet hurt.
- Get used to it.

434
00:30:07,483 --> 00:30:08,848
That's what I like about you.

435
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,584
Your boundless sense
of empathy.

436
00:30:10,586 --> 00:30:12,051
- What did you say?
- Nothing. I...

437
00:30:12,053 --> 00:30:13,820
You're right.
Look, I-I talk too much.

438
00:30:13,822 --> 00:30:15,088
Especially when I'm nervous.

439
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,990
But I'm not gonna talk anymore.

440
00:30:16,992 --> 00:30:18,925
Zipped.

441
00:30:18,927 --> 00:30:21,297
No more talking.

442
00:30:26,101 --> 00:30:28,368
Don't worry about me.

443
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:31,739
I'm more than capable
of looking after myself.

444
00:30:31,741 --> 00:30:34,875
Might surprise you to learn
that I was gonna be an aviator.

445
00:30:34,877 --> 00:30:36,812
I have a faultless sense
of direction.

446
00:30:39,415 --> 00:30:41,080
All right.

447
00:30:41,082 --> 00:30:43,416
Which way?

448
00:30:43,418 --> 00:30:45,452
Oh.

449
00:30:45,454 --> 00:30:49,658
My navigational instincts
tell me...

450
00:30:53,661 --> 00:30:55,995
...we should go...

451
00:30:59,467 --> 00:31:00,800
...that way.

452
00:31:00,802 --> 00:31:02,903
That way, definitely.

453
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:06,072
Those tracks head south.

454
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:07,607
Yeah.

455
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:10,610
You never head south
in the Outlands.

456
00:31:10,612 --> 00:31:12,448
Not ever.

457
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:37,171
I've reconfigured the metrics.

458
00:31:37,173 --> 00:31:38,972
You can amplify
the magnetic resonance

459
00:31:38,974 --> 00:31:41,174
using materials on hand.

460
00:31:41,176 --> 00:31:44,944
- What else do you need?
- Several more weeks.

461
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:47,047
Unless you can find me
more old tech.

462
00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:50,216
All the old tech comes to you.

463
00:31:50,218 --> 00:31:54,154
I'll need more than one
to stabilize the isotopes.

464
00:31:54,156 --> 00:31:55,822
Make it work.

465
00:31:55,824 --> 00:31:58,992
I hear you suffered
an injury this morning.

466
00:31:58,994 --> 00:32:02,665
You never told me
Pandora Shaw had a daughter.

467
00:32:04,867 --> 00:32:07,733
She could be a problem.

468
00:32:07,735 --> 00:32:11,104
She won't stop until I'm dead.

469
00:32:11,106 --> 00:32:13,773
Unless you kill her first.

470
00:32:13,775 --> 00:32:18,544
I received a message from
Sharkmoor Prison this morning.

471
00:32:18,546 --> 00:32:21,714
They claim to have captured
a Stalker.

472
00:32:21,716 --> 00:32:24,617
One of the Resurrected.
A bounty killer gone rogue.

473
00:32:24,619 --> 00:32:27,620
Well, it's no use to us.
Too hard to control.

474
00:32:27,622 --> 00:32:30,190
They say it was hunting
something.

475
00:32:30,192 --> 00:32:32,559
Or someone.

476
00:32:32,561 --> 00:32:35,761
It appears the two of you
share a common interest.

477
00:32:35,763 --> 00:32:39,232
This thing is so fixated
on its prey,

478
00:32:39,234 --> 00:32:42,802
all it does is pound the walls
of its cell,

479
00:32:42,804 --> 00:32:44,740
shrieking her name.

480
00:32:46,207 --> 00:32:48,143
Hester Shaw.

481
00:32:52,615 --> 00:32:54,818
- Where to, boss?
- Sharkmoor Prison.

482
00:33:03,725 --> 00:33:05,125
No fires.

483
00:33:05,127 --> 00:33:06,894
Unless you want every Scav town

484
00:33:06,896 --> 00:33:09,162
from here to Rustwater
to find us.

485
00:33:14,602 --> 00:33:17,003
That, uh... that doesn't look
clean enough to wash in.

486
00:33:17,005 --> 00:33:18,838
I-I wouldn't...

487
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,075
Oh, my God, that's disgusting.

488
00:33:22,077 --> 00:33:24,043
Thirst will kill you
before hunger.

489
00:33:25,147 --> 00:33:28,915
It's either this or you can
drink your own urine.

490
00:33:28,917 --> 00:33:31,186
I'll take my chances.

491
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:03,617
"Best before 2118"?

492
00:34:03,619 --> 00:34:05,117
It's an Inkie.

493
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:07,286
- It's over a thousand years old.
- Doesn't matter.

494
00:34:07,288 --> 00:34:10,190
The food of the Ancients never
goes off. It's indestructible.

495
00:34:32,214 --> 00:34:34,947
It's so quiet out here.

496
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:36,949
Doesn't that bother you?

497
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:39,052
I like the quiet.

498
00:34:39,054 --> 00:34:41,087
I grew up with the sound
of engines.

499
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:42,822
I've never known anything else.

500
00:34:42,824 --> 00:34:45,058
It's funny, you know.

501
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,393
I've spent my whole life
dreaming

502
00:34:46,395 --> 00:34:48,395
of getting off London,
seeing the world,

503
00:34:48,397 --> 00:34:52,302
and now I'm out here, talking
about drinking my own urine.

504
00:34:54,103 --> 00:34:56,103
Careful what you wish for, eh?

505
00:34:56,105 --> 00:34:57,938
I thought you wanted
to be an aviator.

506
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,777
Oh, I did.
But then my parents died.

507
00:35:01,877 --> 00:35:03,777
Eight years ago now.

508
00:35:03,779 --> 00:35:06,849
When Tier Four collapsed
in the Big Tilt.

509
00:35:10,219 --> 00:35:12,386
Yeah.

510
00:35:12,388 --> 00:35:14,154
What about you?

511
00:35:14,156 --> 00:35:16,889
Well, how old were you
when your mother died?

512
00:35:16,891 --> 00:35:20,259
- We're not gonna do this.
- Do what?

513
00:35:20,261 --> 00:35:22,429
We're not gonna tell each other
our sad stories.

514
00:35:22,431 --> 00:35:24,133
I can't help you.

515
00:35:25,234 --> 00:35:27,170
And you can't help me.

516
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:02,804
Hello!

517
00:36:03,971 --> 00:36:06,440
Hello! Over here!

518
00:36:06,442 --> 00:36:08,275
- Tom.
- Hey!

519
00:36:08,277 --> 00:36:10,744
- Get down!
- It's a trading town.

520
00:36:10,746 --> 00:36:12,244
Look, look, look, look.

521
00:36:12,246 --> 00:36:14,417
Look.

522
00:36:16,317 --> 00:36:17,983
Oh, God.

523
00:36:17,985 --> 00:36:19,319
They're Southies.

524
00:36:26,494 --> 00:36:28,395
- That was close.
- Too close.

525
00:36:28,397 --> 00:36:30,132
- Get off me.
- Oh.

526
00:36:32,366 --> 00:36:33,702
Run!

527
00:36:35,804 --> 00:36:36,839
Whoa!

528
00:36:43,746 --> 00:36:45,445
What the hell are Southies?

529
00:36:45,447 --> 00:36:47,380
Scavs on a night hunt.

530
00:36:47,382 --> 00:36:49,349
What are they hunting?

531
00:36:49,351 --> 00:36:51,020
Us.

532
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,729
I've got you.

533
00:37:35,397 --> 00:37:37,333
Come on!

534
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:46,441
Hester? Hester!

535
00:38:01,022 --> 00:38:02,989
Are you in one piece?

536
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:04,324
Yes.

537
00:38:04,326 --> 00:38:06,393
Oh. Oh!

538
00:38:24,313 --> 00:38:27,279
Couple more seconds, and
you'd have been fender meat.

539
00:38:27,281 --> 00:38:30,016
Lucky for you, we was here.

540
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:34,223
How bad is it?

541
00:38:57,478 --> 00:38:59,579
She needs a doctor.

542
00:38:59,581 --> 00:39:02,415
No quacks here.
Not on Scuttlebutt.

543
00:39:02,417 --> 00:39:04,583
Could you take us
to the nearest town?

544
00:39:04,585 --> 00:39:06,286
- What?
- Chipping Sodbury.

545
00:39:06,288 --> 00:39:08,587
That'd be the nearest,
wouldn't you say, Mr. Wreyland?

546
00:39:08,589 --> 00:39:11,190
- I would, my love.
- Well, go on, then.

547
00:39:11,192 --> 00:39:14,661
Set a heading north.
We must look after our guests.

548
00:39:14,663 --> 00:39:16,529
Tea?

549
00:39:16,531 --> 00:39:18,230
Don't mind if I do.

550
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:20,065
I make it myself.

551
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:21,136
The algae's fresh.

552
00:39:24,172 --> 00:39:26,473
Oh, it's actually not bad.

553
00:39:26,475 --> 00:39:28,340
It's not bad. Bottoms up.

554
00:39:28,342 --> 00:39:29,576
Funny you should say that.

555
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:32,281
We grow it in the runoff
under the sewage room.

556
00:39:35,317 --> 00:39:39,552
Oh, nasty.
That's gonna leave a scar.

557
00:39:39,554 --> 00:39:42,157
You don't need any more
of those, do you, Petal?

558
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:52,599
Disembark
here for Digestion Yards,

559
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:55,501
Incomer Processing
and Main Engine Rooms.

560
00:39:55,503 --> 00:39:58,938
Bevis. Bevis Pod.
I need to speak to you.

561
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,273
- I can't help you.
- Wha...?

562
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:01,608
The-the girl
that attacked my father...

563
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,242
I don't know what
you're talking about.

564
00:40:03,244 --> 00:40:05,445
What do you mean?
You were there.

565
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:07,646
You saw what happened.

566
00:40:07,648 --> 00:40:08,715
Nether Borough Station.

567
00:40:08,717 --> 00:40:10,150
Disembark here for

568
00:40:10,152 --> 00:40:11,518
Digestion Yards,
Incomer Processing...

569
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,253
Are you trying
to get me arrested?

570
00:40:13,255 --> 00:40:15,587
The first rule down here is:
"Keep your mouth shut."

571
00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:17,090
My father's in
some kind of trouble.

572
00:40:17,092 --> 00:40:18,458
He's lying to me.
I need to know why.

573
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,994
Your father lies
to a lot of people.

574
00:40:20,996 --> 00:40:23,228
What's that supposed to mean?

575
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:26,266
Please.
I just want to know the truth.

576
00:40:26,268 --> 00:40:28,168
- No, you don't.
- I promise you. My father's a good man.

577
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,703
- He would never do...
- No, just stop. Stop.

578
00:40:29,705 --> 00:40:31,103
He pushed him.

579
00:40:31,105 --> 00:40:33,642
Your father pushed Tom
off the city.

580
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,643
Why?

581
00:40:37,645 --> 00:40:40,212
Why would he do that to Tom?

582
00:40:40,214 --> 00:40:42,384
Because he got in the way.

583
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,694
It's a lie.

584
00:40:54,696 --> 00:40:56,596
A cover-up.

585
00:40:56,598 --> 00:40:59,969
They're building something
in there.

586
00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:03,636
Something they don't want
anyone to see.

587
00:41:03,638 --> 00:41:05,607
Excuse me, ma'am.

588
00:41:08,377 --> 00:41:10,376
I tried to get inside,

589
00:41:10,378 --> 00:41:13,012
but there are guards
at every entrance.

590
00:41:13,014 --> 00:41:15,016
There's no way in.

591
00:41:18,552 --> 00:41:20,489
What if there was?

592
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:34,333
<i>Here we are, then.</i>

593
00:41:34,335 --> 00:41:36,802
<i>It's not the Lord Mayor's Suite
at the Boggy Regis,</i>

594
00:41:36,804 --> 00:41:40,572
but it's better than a poke
in the eye with a burnt stick.

595
00:41:40,574 --> 00:41:41,741
Mm.

596
00:41:46,447 --> 00:41:48,380
Make yourselves at home.

597
00:41:48,382 --> 00:41:51,721
I'll be back bright and early
to empty your slops.

598
00:41:53,688 --> 00:41:55,487
- Thank you.
- Not much of a talker, is she?

599
00:41:55,489 --> 00:41:57,290
Your girlfriend.

600
00:41:57,292 --> 00:41:58,757
Oh, no, no, no, no, she's
not... she's not my girlfriend.

601
00:41:58,759 --> 00:42:00,092
Of course not.

602
00:42:00,094 --> 00:42:02,094
Handsome boy like you.

603
00:42:02,096 --> 00:42:04,197
You can do much better.

604
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:06,465
All right, well, good night,
Mrs. Wreyland.

605
00:42:06,467 --> 00:42:08,333
Oh, dear. There I go
putting me foot in it.

606
00:42:08,335 --> 00:42:10,770
- I didn't mean...
- No, I know what you meant.

607
00:42:10,772 --> 00:42:12,708
Look, you-you take the bed;
I'll take the...

608
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:17,643
...floor.

609
00:42:31,192 --> 00:42:33,659
This is all my fault.

610
00:42:33,661 --> 00:42:36,464
I'm sorry.

611
00:42:40,368 --> 00:42:43,302
I was eight.

612
00:42:43,304 --> 00:42:47,373
I was eight years old
when my mother died.

613
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:51,110
She was an archaeologist.

614
00:42:51,112 --> 00:42:56,551
She loved traveling the world
and digging up the past.

615
00:43:03,391 --> 00:43:05,125
They're beautiful.

616
00:43:12,868 --> 00:43:15,134
<i>He used to visit all the time.</i>

617
00:43:16,505 --> 00:43:19,338
<i>He'd spend hours</i>

618
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,375
<i>poring over the things
that she had found.</i>

619
00:43:24,346 --> 00:43:26,478
<i>Then one day...</i>

620
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,616
everything changed.

621
00:43:30,518 --> 00:43:32,518
<i>She'd found something</i>

622
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,920
<i>on one of her digs
in Lost America.</i>

623
00:43:34,922 --> 00:43:36,391
<i>Something he wanted.</i>

624
00:43:40,529 --> 00:43:44,329
- Pandora, what are you doing?
- No. No. No.

625
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:45,831
What was it?

626
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:47,933
I don't know.

627
00:43:47,935 --> 00:43:49,802
Stop it! Don't do this!

628
00:43:49,804 --> 00:43:50,869
Let go of me!

629
00:43:50,871 --> 00:43:52,471
- I'm taking it.
- No.

630
00:43:55,877 --> 00:43:58,878
Mom!

631
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,380
Mama.

632
00:44:00,382 --> 00:44:02,585
Hester, take this.

633
00:44:03,752 --> 00:44:05,217
Keep it safe.

634
00:44:06,388 --> 00:44:07,654
<i>Mama!</i>

635
00:44:07,656 --> 00:44:09,322
But he killed her for it.

636
00:44:14,696 --> 00:44:16,795
Mom! Mama!

637
00:44:26,975 --> 00:44:28,476
Run, Hester!

638
00:44:32,813 --> 00:44:33,779
Hester!

639
00:44:33,781 --> 00:44:35,583
<i>He would have killed me, too.</i>

640
00:44:47,362 --> 00:44:49,298
But I got away.

641
00:45:05,279 --> 00:45:07,614
We caught it
on the edge of the marshlands.

642
00:45:07,616 --> 00:45:10,250
- Please stop!
- It had torn apart a whole town.

643
00:45:10,252 --> 00:45:12,251
- Murdered them all.
- Stop it!

644
00:45:12,253 --> 00:45:14,487
I lost a dozen good men
bringing it in.

645
00:45:14,489 --> 00:45:16,422
Hester!

646
00:45:16,424 --> 00:45:18,791
There'd always been rumors
that a few had survived,

647
00:45:18,793 --> 00:45:20,659
the ones that turned rogue
after the Nomad Wars.

648
00:45:20,661 --> 00:45:22,328
Hester!

649
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:24,630
But I never thought I'd live
to see one in the flesh.

650
00:45:26,034 --> 00:45:28,601
Not that there's much
of that left.

651
00:45:28,603 --> 00:45:31,773
Hester!

652
00:45:33,641 --> 00:45:35,974
Hester!

653
00:45:57,799 --> 00:46:00,735
The last
of the Lazarus Brigade.

654
00:46:03,404 --> 00:46:06,338
Resurrected from
the sleep of death.

655
00:46:07,509 --> 00:46:10,476
I do not sleep.

656
00:46:10,478 --> 00:46:13,715
No, you've been hunting her,
haven't you?

657
00:46:15,516 --> 00:46:17,953
Hunting Hester Shaw.

658
00:46:19,487 --> 00:46:21,020
Why?

659
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:25,293
Answer me.

660
00:46:29,496 --> 00:46:34,567
She broke her promise.

661
00:46:42,944 --> 00:46:46,045
What happens when you find her?

662
00:46:46,047 --> 00:46:49,549
What happens
when you find Hester Shaw?

663
00:46:49,551 --> 00:46:54,487
I will kill her.

664
00:47:04,098 --> 00:47:06,498
Are you sure about this?

665
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,434
There's no telling
what that thing might do.

666
00:47:09,436 --> 00:47:11,806
I know exactly what it will do.

667
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,547
Hold it steady.

668
00:48:17,871 --> 00:48:19,806
Oh, what-what's wrong?

669
00:48:19,808 --> 00:48:21,574
We've changed direction.
We're heading south.

670
00:48:21,576 --> 00:48:22,811
Get the door.

671
00:48:24,179 --> 00:48:26,579
It's locked.

672
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:28,883
We're locked in.

673
00:48:30,585 --> 00:48:32,755
Must be something around here.

674
00:48:37,926 --> 00:48:39,628
All right. Maybe.

675
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:44,665
You have my knife?

676
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:19,197
If we climb along that ducting,
we can jump from the back.

677
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:21,601
It's no more than,
like, 20 feet.

678
00:49:21,603 --> 00:49:23,869
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

679
00:49:23,871 --> 00:49:27,540
No, I can't.
I'll-I'll never make the jump.

680
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:30,145
Uh, you will. I'll help you.

681
00:49:34,047 --> 00:49:35,514
Head due north.

682
00:49:35,516 --> 00:49:37,282
There's a way station
called Ramskate.

683
00:49:37,284 --> 00:49:39,117
You can catch an airfreighter
from there.

684
00:49:40,788 --> 00:49:43,154
- Get him out! Move it!
- Go.

685
00:49:43,156 --> 00:49:44,657
- All right.
- Come on, you lot.

686
00:49:44,659 --> 00:49:45,891
Fine.

687
00:49:45,893 --> 00:49:47,293
Ah, stop your sniveling.

688
00:49:50,697 --> 00:49:52,234
Help!

689
00:49:55,837 --> 00:49:57,539
What are you waiting for? Go.

690
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:03,608
- Come here.
- No!

691
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:05,844
- Come here.
- Listen to me.

692
00:50:05,846 --> 00:50:08,813
<i>Hai-ji!</i>

693
00:50:08,815 --> 00:50:10,282
No! No!

694
00:50:10,284 --> 00:50:12,018
<i>Ya ma-tee bihd.</i>

695
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,320
Time to check out, folks.

696
00:50:19,826 --> 00:50:21,927
- Come on, out you come.
- No.

697
00:50:21,929 --> 00:50:22,929
No.

698
00:50:22,931 --> 00:50:24,630
Move it!

699
00:50:29,069 --> 00:50:31,203
- That was your chance.
- Well, I couldn't do it.

700
00:50:31,205 --> 00:50:33,306
I couldn't leave you.

701
00:50:33,308 --> 00:50:36,576
Well, then you're a fool.
I would've left you.

702
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:46,251
Ladies and gentlemen...

703
00:50:46,253 --> 00:50:48,154
Welcome to Rustwater Market.

704
00:50:50,157 --> 00:50:52,824
This next item
is a vintage piece.

705
00:50:54,261 --> 00:50:56,728
Now, she may look a little
tatty around the edges,

706
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:59,130
but she's a little ripper.

707
00:51:00,802 --> 00:51:03,969
So, who'll give me 12 quirkes?

708
00:51:03,971 --> 00:51:05,938
Eh?

709
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:08,107
Oh, come on.

710
00:51:08,109 --> 00:51:11,911
Last chance to secure
this genuine antique.

711
00:51:11,913 --> 00:51:14,313
Ten quirkes,
or I'm chucking her in.

712
00:51:14,315 --> 00:51:15,780
- Two!
- Sold!

713
00:51:15,782 --> 00:51:17,819
Next!

714
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:26,726
Oh, yeah.

715
00:51:26,728 --> 00:51:28,226
Stone the crows.

716
00:51:28,228 --> 00:51:32,098
Full disclosure to
my valued clients at the back:

717
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,866
This one is a real swamp donkey

718
00:51:34,868 --> 00:51:36,402
and priced accordingly.

719
00:51:36,404 --> 00:51:38,804
Do I have ten quirkes?

720
00:51:38,806 --> 00:51:41,072
- Three.
- Oh, you stingy bastard, De Groot.

721
00:51:41,074 --> 00:51:42,875
You could do better than that.

722
00:51:42,877 --> 00:51:45,110
I'm fully aware
of the exorbitant margins

723
00:51:45,112 --> 00:51:48,246
currently enjoyed
by the sausage-making sector.

724
00:51:48,248 --> 00:51:50,382
Hester!

725
00:51:50,384 --> 00:51:51,817
Five quirkes, and she's yours.

726
00:51:51,819 --> 00:51:53,319
- Four.
- Four quirkes to my left.

727
00:51:53,321 --> 00:51:55,087
- Do I hear five?
- Hester!

728
00:51:55,089 --> 00:51:56,255
Shut up!

729
00:51:56,257 --> 00:51:57,389
Cheer up, love.

730
00:51:59,127 --> 00:52:01,761
You'll look considerably better
as a roll of salami.

731
00:52:01,763 --> 00:52:02,994
Going once.

732
00:52:02,996 --> 00:52:05,697
- Going twice.
- 50!

733
00:52:11,072 --> 00:52:13,005
An unregistered bidder.

734
00:52:13,007 --> 00:52:17,076
Please, approach the stage.

735
00:52:37,431 --> 00:52:40,199
50 quirkes
for this soggy dollop is

736
00:52:40,201 --> 00:52:42,201
an extraordinarily
generous offer, madam.

737
00:52:42,203 --> 00:52:45,704
Normally, that would be enough
to make me self-pollinate.

738
00:52:45,706 --> 00:52:48,373
But my problem is this:

739
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:52,110
50 quirkes
is not 50,000 quirkes.

740
00:52:52,112 --> 00:52:54,012
Get to the point.

741
00:52:54,014 --> 00:52:56,114
Well, it's quite simple,
really.

742
00:52:56,116 --> 00:53:00,119
There is a bounty
on your head, Miss Fang.

743
00:53:00,121 --> 00:53:03,422
So, either you pay me
50,000 quirkes for the girlie,

744
00:53:03,424 --> 00:53:07,293
or I claim it from the
authorities when I hand you in.

745
00:53:07,295 --> 00:53:09,261
Why don't we settle this...

746
00:53:10,732 --> 00:53:11,667
...with "buy it now."

747
00:53:13,366 --> 00:53:15,067
Hester!

748
00:53:15,069 --> 00:53:16,335
Come!

749
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,840
- Wait!
- Hester!

750
00:53:21,842 --> 00:53:23,375
Hurry!

751
00:53:32,052 --> 00:53:33,755
Anti-Tractionists!

752
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,159
See, I knew
you wouldn't leave me.

753
00:53:41,161 --> 00:53:42,994
Shut up and run.

754
00:53:42,996 --> 00:53:45,364
Anti-Tractionists!

755
00:53:45,366 --> 00:53:48,235
Anti-Tractionists!

756
00:53:50,804 --> 00:53:52,273
Whoa!

757
00:53:55,042 --> 00:53:56,744
This way.

758
00:54:00,281 --> 00:54:01,248
Whoa!

759
00:54:30,377 --> 00:54:33,244
- That's a Resurrected Man.
- Shrike.

760
00:54:33,246 --> 00:54:35,480
His name is Shrike.

761
00:54:35,482 --> 00:54:39,018
You made me a promise,

762
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:42,121
Hester Shaw.

763
00:54:42,123 --> 00:54:46,192
Now you must keep it.

764
00:54:46,194 --> 00:54:48,027
Go now! Run!

765
00:54:48,029 --> 00:54:49,164
This way!

766
00:54:55,902 --> 00:54:57,906
Come on! Come on!

767
00:55:21,127 --> 00:55:23,429
Hester! Come on.

768
00:55:47,121 --> 00:55:48,990
Where did he go?

769
00:55:54,328 --> 00:55:56,063
Come on. Come on!

770
00:56:09,643 --> 00:56:11,346
Hester!

771
00:56:21,221 --> 00:56:22,489
Get on!

772
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:27,960
I've got you.

773
00:56:31,531 --> 00:56:33,167
- Wait!
- Leave him.

774
00:56:36,971 --> 00:56:38,536
Tom!

775
00:57:02,964 --> 00:57:04,498
Cut the rope! Do it!

776
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:14,308
Catch!

777
00:58:15,469 --> 00:58:17,302
Where are you taking us?

778
00:58:17,304 --> 00:58:19,975
Just stay behind me.
I'll handle this.

779
00:58:26,614 --> 00:58:27,581
How?

780
00:58:29,049 --> 00:58:30,681
How exactly will you handle it?

781
00:58:30,683 --> 00:58:33,152
Easy, all right?

782
00:58:33,154 --> 00:58:35,023
Just...

783
00:58:43,264 --> 00:58:45,264
I'm just messing with you.

784
00:58:45,266 --> 00:58:48,436
Sit down. Both of you.

785
00:58:54,507 --> 00:58:56,507
That means you, too, city boy.

786
00:58:56,509 --> 00:58:58,312
Sit.

787
00:59:00,614 --> 00:59:02,217
You're injured.

788
00:59:15,496 --> 00:59:18,197
You saved our lives.

789
00:59:18,199 --> 00:59:20,068
Why?

790
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:25,639
You don't trust anybody,
do you?

791
00:59:26,873 --> 00:59:28,873
Just like your mother.

792
00:59:28,875 --> 00:59:31,742
You look like her, too.

793
00:59:31,744 --> 00:59:33,811
You knew her?

794
00:59:33,813 --> 00:59:37,849
Pandora Shaw was
the bravest woman I ever met.

795
00:59:37,851 --> 00:59:41,455
After she died,
I looked for you.

796
00:59:42,857 --> 00:59:46,190
I looked for a long time.

797
00:59:46,192 --> 00:59:50,195
Like everybody else,
I thought you were dead.

798
00:59:50,197 --> 00:59:55,467
When I heard you were alive,
made me wonder,

799
00:59:55,469 --> 00:59:58,402
how did an eight-year-old girl

800
00:59:58,404 --> 01:00:01,743
survive all alone
in the Outlands?

801
01:00:04,145 --> 01:00:05,813
Now I know.

802
01:00:14,288 --> 01:00:18,157
You were raised by that corpse.

803
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:20,192
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Actually, I do.

804
01:00:20,194 --> 01:00:21,427
- No, you don't.
- I've studied them.

805
01:00:21,429 --> 01:00:23,895
- You've studied them?
- I know a lot about the Resurrected.

806
01:00:23,897 --> 01:00:25,297
You don't know anything
about him.

807
01:00:25,299 --> 01:00:27,666
The people who created them
were insane.

808
01:00:27,668 --> 01:00:29,601
Off-the-charts crazy.
They took all the worst parts

809
01:00:29,603 --> 01:00:30,569
- of themselves...
- Shut up.

810
01:00:30,571 --> 01:00:33,271
...all the savagery
and cruelty and hatred,

811
01:00:33,273 --> 01:00:34,907
and poured it into these
machines, these monsters.

812
01:00:34,909 --> 01:00:36,241
Shut up!

813
01:00:36,243 --> 01:00:37,846
He saved my life.

814
01:00:47,188 --> 01:00:48,920
You're an idiot.

815
01:01:01,201 --> 01:01:02,967
Mr. Valentine.

816
01:01:02,969 --> 01:01:05,536
- Not now.
- I'm sure you know who I am.

817
01:01:05,538 --> 01:01:07,940
- No, I don't.
- Herbert Melliphant.

818
01:01:07,942 --> 01:01:09,942
Your daughter's
a very good friend of mine.

819
01:01:09,944 --> 01:01:12,411
No, she's not.

820
01:01:12,413 --> 01:01:14,846
Sir, I have something
that may be of interest to you.

821
01:01:14,848 --> 01:01:16,782
A cache of old tech.

822
01:01:16,784 --> 01:01:19,617
High-quality, military-grade.

823
01:01:19,619 --> 01:01:22,286
I'm overdue a promotion myself.

824
01:01:22,288 --> 01:01:25,857
I'm thinking a university post
or an honorary degree?

825
01:01:25,859 --> 01:01:28,527
A position with a title.

826
01:01:28,529 --> 01:01:32,567
You have a supply of old tech?

827
01:01:35,302 --> 01:01:37,405
Where is it?

828
01:02:08,802 --> 01:02:11,940
Shrike saved my life.

829
01:03:00,353 --> 01:03:02,554
<i>He took me in.</i>

830
01:03:02,556 --> 01:03:03,992
<i>He looked after me.</i>

831
01:03:05,893 --> 01:03:08,659
<i>In his own way.</i>

832
01:03:08,661 --> 01:03:10,661
Eat.

833
01:03:10,663 --> 01:03:14,502
The living must eat.

834
01:03:21,741 --> 01:03:24,608
<i>He liked to collect things.</i>

835
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:26,413
<i>Broken things.</i>

836
01:03:28,415 --> 01:03:31,552
<i>Things that others
had thrown away.</i>

837
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:39,724
<i>I think he saw
in those strange machines</i>

838
01:03:39,726 --> 01:03:43,462
<i>a reflection of himself.</i>

839
01:03:43,464 --> 01:03:45,931
Where is his heart?

840
01:03:45,933 --> 01:03:50,338
It has no heart.

841
01:03:51,438 --> 01:03:53,808
Like me.

842
01:04:13,793 --> 01:04:16,695
<i>I think, somewhere deep inside,</i>

843
01:04:16,697 --> 01:04:19,767
<i>a memory remained.</i>

844
01:04:23,103 --> 01:04:26,074
<i>A memory from another life.</i>

845
01:04:33,614 --> 01:04:35,983
I think he had a family once.

846
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:50,128
You are sad.

847
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:55,470
Always sad, Hester Shaw.

848
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:04,946
Your heart is broken.

849
01:05:06,813 --> 01:05:12,719
I will take away the pain.

850
01:05:37,877 --> 01:05:42,514
I will remake you,

851
01:05:42,516 --> 01:05:47,619
as I was remade.

852
01:05:47,621 --> 01:05:49,987
You're gonna kill me.

853
01:05:49,989 --> 01:05:53,558
For a little while.

854
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:56,561
I made him a promise.

855
01:05:56,563 --> 01:05:59,130
<i>I would become like him.</i>

856
01:05:59,132 --> 01:06:01,900
<i>My flesh, steel.</i>

857
01:06:01,902 --> 01:06:05,203
<i>My nerves, wire.</i>

858
01:06:05,205 --> 01:06:08,139
<i>My mind wiped clean.</i>

859
01:06:08,141 --> 01:06:10,275
<i>No thoughts.</i>

860
01:06:10,277 --> 01:06:12,844
- No!
- <i>No feelings.</i>

861
01:06:12,846 --> 01:06:15,817
- Mom!
- <i>Nothing.</i>

862
01:06:17,284 --> 01:06:19,784
I would be free.

863
01:06:19,786 --> 01:06:22,987
If that's what you wanted,
why did you leave?

864
01:06:22,989 --> 01:06:27,558
Because six months ago,
London crossed the land bridge,

865
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:31,228
and Thaddeus Valentine
came within my reach.

866
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:37,170
Hester...!

867
01:06:46,947 --> 01:06:48,516
That's it.

868
01:06:49,683 --> 01:06:51,853
That's my sad story.

869
01:07:10,703 --> 01:07:13,137
Where are we going?

870
01:07:13,139 --> 01:07:15,172
Have you heard
of the Cat's Cradle?

871
01:07:15,174 --> 01:07:17,208
The Cat's Cradle?
I thought it was a myth.

872
01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:19,009
It's not a myth.

873
01:07:19,011 --> 01:07:22,346
It was built by the Scriven
in the first days of London.

874
01:07:22,348 --> 01:07:24,648
It's the sort of thing
historians know about

875
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:26,150
and everyone else
has forgotten.

876
01:07:26,152 --> 01:07:28,022
You're too late.

877
01:07:30,690 --> 01:07:32,824
Dr. Pomeroy?

878
01:07:32,826 --> 01:07:34,259
They came in this morning,

879
01:07:34,261 --> 01:07:36,293
a couple of thugs
from the Guild of Engineers.

880
01:07:36,295 --> 01:07:39,630
I tried to stop them.
They knocked me to the ground.

881
01:07:39,632 --> 01:07:41,701
They knew what
they were looking for.

882
01:07:43,170 --> 01:07:44,902
They cleaned the place out.

883
01:07:44,904 --> 01:07:46,940
Took it all to St. Paul's.

884
01:08:02,121 --> 01:08:05,857
There are over a thousand
stairs in the Cradle.

885
01:08:05,859 --> 01:08:07,791
Turn upon turn.

886
01:08:07,793 --> 01:08:11,128
But eventually they lead to
the crypt beneath St. Paul's.

887
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:13,098
Be careful, child.

888
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:15,399
Whatever it is
they are doing in that church

889
01:08:15,401 --> 01:08:17,868
has nothing to do with God.

890
01:08:41,895 --> 01:08:43,864
Hold her steady for a second.

891
01:09:02,014 --> 01:09:03,747
Not bad.

892
01:09:03,749 --> 01:09:05,350
You've done this before?

893
01:09:05,352 --> 01:09:07,622
Yeah. A bit.

894
01:09:10,057 --> 01:09:12,357
<i>Good. You can take her in.</i>

895
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:14,829
Take her in? Where?

896
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:29,707
<i>You are cleared for landing,</i>

897
01:09:29,709 --> 01:09:32,377
Jenny Haniver. <i>Dock seven.</i>

898
01:09:32,379 --> 01:09:34,181
<i>Welcome to Airhaven.</i>

899
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,207
What are they saying?

900
01:10:36,209 --> 01:10:39,476
Captain Khora was just offering
to buy you dinner.

901
01:10:39,478 --> 01:10:41,315
Weren't you, Captain?

902
01:10:42,548 --> 01:10:45,151
Sure. Why not?

903
01:10:50,557 --> 01:10:52,991
Magnetic resonance is climbing,

904
01:10:52,993 --> 01:10:54,458
holding at full capacity.

905
01:10:58,197 --> 01:11:00,198
All systems are active.

906
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:03,033
She's ready.

907
01:11:03,035 --> 01:11:06,237
It will all be for nothing
unless we act now.

908
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:09,176
London must turn east.

909
01:11:13,379 --> 01:11:16,381
<i>New bearing
confirmed, 90 degrees.</i>

910
01:11:16,383 --> 01:11:18,248
Coordinates set:
51 degrees north

911
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:20,318
by 71 degrees east.

912
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,586
Why are we altering course?

913
01:11:22,588 --> 01:11:25,290
We're executing
the new order, sir.

914
01:11:25,292 --> 01:11:27,861
Whose order?

915
01:11:42,575 --> 01:11:44,511
Windflower.

916
01:12:31,490 --> 01:12:33,291
Wh-Wh-Whoa, what's going on?

917
01:12:33,293 --> 01:12:34,926
They're the Ruh-shan.

918
01:12:34,928 --> 01:12:36,864
The Anti-Traction League
of Shan Guo.

919
01:12:38,298 --> 01:12:41,131
This is about my mother,
isn't it?

920
01:12:41,133 --> 01:12:45,603
Before she died,
Pandora found something.

921
01:12:45,605 --> 01:12:48,105
Something dangerous.

922
01:12:48,107 --> 01:12:51,009
She was afraid of Valentine,
of what he might do.

923
01:12:51,011 --> 01:12:53,010
She said, if anything
should happen to her,

924
01:12:53,012 --> 01:12:55,279
I was to find you.

925
01:12:55,281 --> 01:12:57,081
That you could stop him.

926
01:12:57,083 --> 01:12:59,117
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Think.

927
01:12:59,119 --> 01:13:00,652
Think hard.

928
01:13:00,654 --> 01:13:02,356
You must remember.

929
01:13:05,357 --> 01:13:07,625
He took something from her.

930
01:13:07,627 --> 01:13:09,493
What? What did he take?

931
01:13:09,495 --> 01:13:11,528
A piece of old tech.

932
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:14,265
- What kind of old tech?
- I don't know.

933
01:13:14,267 --> 01:13:16,935
She was eight years old.
She doesn't remember.

934
01:13:16,937 --> 01:13:19,002
Then perhaps you can help us,
Londoner.

935
01:13:19,004 --> 01:13:20,404
- Hey!
- Hey.

936
01:13:20,406 --> 01:13:22,439
Get off me! Get off!

937
01:13:22,441 --> 01:13:25,879
What are they building
in that cathedral?

938
01:13:36,423 --> 01:13:38,456
<i>Six months ago,</i>

939
01:13:38,458 --> 01:13:40,324
Valentine started buying up
fusion inverter cells

940
01:13:40,326 --> 01:13:42,159
- from Scav traders.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

941
01:13:42,161 --> 01:13:44,162
- Fusion inverters?
- You know something?

942
01:13:44,164 --> 01:13:46,096
No, that's...

943
01:13:46,098 --> 01:13:47,332
that's impossible.

944
01:13:47,334 --> 01:13:49,203
He'd have had to have found...

945
01:14:00,312 --> 01:14:02,579
<i>That piece of old tech
that Valentine took</i>

946
01:14:02,581 --> 01:14:04,748
from your mother,
did it have a symbol on it?

947
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:06,052
Like...

948
01:14:09,155 --> 01:14:10,691
Like this?

949
01:14:21,167 --> 01:14:22,367
Yes.

950
01:14:22,369 --> 01:14:24,568
<i>Your mother found</i>

951
01:14:24,570 --> 01:14:26,503
a computer core.

952
01:14:26,505 --> 01:14:29,707
The control system
of a quantum energy weapon.

953
01:14:36,615 --> 01:14:39,252
Medusa is live.

954
01:14:41,286 --> 01:14:43,190
Go, go, go.

955
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:46,524
- How do we shut it down?
- You don't.

956
01:14:46,526 --> 01:14:48,359
Well, not without
the crash drive.

957
01:14:48,361 --> 01:14:51,595
- <i>Anglish, halviti.</i>
- It's a type of key.

958
01:14:51,597 --> 01:14:54,165
A kill switch that overrides
the firing sequence.

959
01:14:54,167 --> 01:14:56,567
Once it's initiated, the weapon
would self-destruct.

960
01:14:56,569 --> 01:14:58,735
This key, does London have it?

961
01:14:58,737 --> 01:15:00,371
No, it would be
long gone, lost.

962
01:15:00,373 --> 01:15:02,206
Why should we care
about those barbarians?

963
01:15:02,208 --> 01:15:04,408
Let Valentine burn
every Traction City

964
01:15:04,410 --> 01:15:06,411
from here to the Ice Wastes.

965
01:15:06,413 --> 01:15:08,246
He didn't come here
looking for prey.

966
01:15:08,248 --> 01:15:11,051
Valentine has
another target in mind.

967
01:15:13,319 --> 01:15:16,123
You dare countermand
an order of Lord Mayor?

968
01:15:22,529 --> 01:15:24,761
My God.

969
01:15:26,732 --> 01:15:29,332
Nothing can stand
in the face of this.

970
01:15:29,334 --> 01:15:31,301
Not the battle hammers
of Arkangel,

971
01:15:31,303 --> 01:15:33,671
not the howitzers
of Panzerstadt.

972
01:15:33,673 --> 01:15:36,707
Not even the guns
of the Anti-Tractionists.

973
01:15:36,709 --> 01:15:41,378
In the great game of survival,
this is checkmate.

974
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:43,747
London's heading east.

975
01:15:43,749 --> 01:15:46,716
They are moving at speed
towards Shan Guo.

976
01:15:46,718 --> 01:15:49,487
I last saw them
near the Tannhauser Mountains.

977
01:15:49,489 --> 01:15:51,189
They will have reached
the Eastern Plateau by now.

978
01:15:51,191 --> 01:15:54,628
- How much time do we have?
- A few hours, at most.

979
01:15:56,396 --> 01:15:58,662
You mean to go to war?

980
01:15:58,664 --> 01:16:00,398
You cannot ignore

981
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:03,533
the lessons of the past
as if they count for nothing.

982
01:16:03,535 --> 01:16:06,570
There are no lessons
to be learned from the past.

983
01:16:06,572 --> 01:16:08,506
History doesn't care.

984
01:16:08,508 --> 01:16:10,108
It is dead.

985
01:16:10,110 --> 01:16:12,243
This is the future.

986
01:16:12,245 --> 01:16:16,113
The man who controls this
controls the world.

987
01:16:16,115 --> 01:16:19,585
Is there no end
to your ambition?

988
01:16:21,353 --> 01:16:25,256
You control nothing.

989
01:16:25,258 --> 01:16:27,757
Shut this down.

990
01:16:27,759 --> 01:16:30,661
I want all codes
and operational controls

991
01:16:30,663 --> 01:16:34,465
handed in to my office
immediately.

992
01:16:34,467 --> 01:16:36,900
Didn't you hear me?

993
01:16:36,902 --> 01:16:38,536
I said...

994
01:16:43,543 --> 01:16:46,743
You cling to the past
as if it can save you.

995
01:16:46,745 --> 01:16:49,546
You're a relic of a dying age.

996
01:16:49,548 --> 01:16:51,815
A dinosaur.

997
01:16:51,817 --> 01:16:54,618
What does that make you?

998
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:58,124
Me? I'm the meteor.

999
01:17:01,393 --> 01:17:03,461
Katherine, come on. Come on.

1000
01:17:04,897 --> 01:17:06,831
No, no. Katherine.

1001
01:17:08,767 --> 01:17:10,703
You can't go back.

1002
01:17:11,803 --> 01:17:13,871
I know he's your father.

1003
01:17:13,873 --> 01:17:16,210
You have to let him go.

1004
01:17:21,748 --> 01:17:23,948
He's not my father.

1005
01:17:23,950 --> 01:17:25,552
Not anymore.

1006
01:17:35,395 --> 01:17:37,295
They're gonna attack
the Shield Wall.

1007
01:17:37,297 --> 01:17:38,863
Get word to Governor Kwan.

1008
01:17:38,865 --> 01:17:40,931
Hey!

1009
01:17:40,933 --> 01:17:42,699
For crying out loud.

1010
01:17:42,701 --> 01:17:45,269
- Hey!
- Check the fuel line!

1011
01:17:45,271 --> 01:17:46,570
Power's out everywhere.

1012
01:17:46,572 --> 01:17:48,271
What is it? What's going on?

1013
01:17:48,273 --> 01:17:50,308
It's a diversion.

1014
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:51,609
Fire!

1015
01:17:51,611 --> 01:17:52,976
To create chaos.

1016
01:17:52,978 --> 01:17:55,712
Fire!

1017
01:17:55,714 --> 01:17:57,348
What the hell is that?!

1018
01:17:57,350 --> 01:17:58,518
Shrike is here.

1019
01:18:04,656 --> 01:18:08,225
Hester Shaw.

1020
01:18:08,227 --> 01:18:09,693
No!

1021
01:18:09,695 --> 01:18:11,528
- Get back!
- Stop! Don't shoot!

1022
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:12,963
Shrike, get out!

1023
01:18:12,965 --> 01:18:15,565
No! Stop shooting!

1024
01:18:15,567 --> 01:18:17,667
Anna! Get off!

1025
01:18:17,669 --> 01:18:21,505
Listen to me! Stop! Stop!

1026
01:18:21,507 --> 01:18:23,576
Shrike, no! Anna, no!

1027
01:18:34,353 --> 01:18:35,556
Nils!

1028
01:18:42,995 --> 01:18:45,695
- <i>Ka se-wo! Pou ya tek!</i>
- No!

1029
01:18:45,697 --> 01:18:47,732
Listen to me, Shrike!

1030
01:18:53,772 --> 01:18:55,006
<i>Koyo se!</i>

1031
01:19:04,517 --> 01:19:05,983
Get to the <i>Jenny</i> now!

1032
01:19:05,985 --> 01:19:07,955
Go! Go!

1033
01:19:09,388 --> 01:19:11,757
Hester!

1034
01:19:18,298 --> 01:19:19,532
Watch out.

1035
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:53,963
Nils!

1036
01:19:53,965 --> 01:19:56,033
Get down!

1037
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,648
Everybody, move!

1038
01:20:12,352 --> 01:20:14,752
All aviators, evacuate now!

1039
01:20:14,754 --> 01:20:17,387
I repeat, evacuate now!

1040
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:34,041
Come on!

1041
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:40,744
This way!

1042
01:20:51,891 --> 01:20:54,591
Hester.

1043
01:21:05,704 --> 01:21:07,771
No!

1044
01:21:10,910 --> 01:21:12,710
No.

1045
01:21:12,712 --> 01:21:14,010
Tom! No!

1046
01:21:14,012 --> 01:21:15,078
No! Stop!

1047
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,713
Stop, Shrike!

1048
01:21:16,715 --> 01:21:19,116
Stop. You're gonna kill him.

1049
01:21:19,118 --> 01:21:24,054
You will not remember him.

1050
01:21:24,056 --> 01:21:26,890
No. I'm the one.

1051
01:21:26,892 --> 01:21:29,059
I'm the one you came for.

1052
01:21:29,061 --> 01:21:30,627
Let him go.

1053
01:21:30,629 --> 01:21:32,630
Let him live.

1054
01:21:34,667 --> 01:21:39,670
You are crying.

1055
01:21:39,672 --> 01:21:41,872
- He hurt you!
- No.

1056
01:21:41,874 --> 01:21:42,973
He can't die.

1057
01:21:42,975 --> 01:21:45,042
He can't.

1058
01:21:45,044 --> 01:21:46,580
He can't!

1059
01:21:51,217 --> 01:21:53,053
He can't.

1060
01:22:00,125 --> 01:22:01,895
You...

1061
01:22:03,995 --> 01:22:05,431
You...

1062
01:22:06,566 --> 01:22:09,936
You love him?

1063
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:27,020
Shrike?

1064
01:22:33,124 --> 01:22:34,992
No!

1065
01:22:34,994 --> 01:22:36,830
No, Shrike!

1066
01:22:53,579 --> 01:22:57,213
This belongs to you.

1067
01:23:07,293 --> 01:23:10,860
I release you

1068
01:23:10,862 --> 01:23:14,732
from your promise,

1069
01:23:14,734 --> 01:23:19,737
Hester Shaw.

1070
01:23:31,851 --> 01:23:33,820
Shrike.

1071
01:23:40,759 --> 01:23:44,030
Shrike!

1072
01:24:29,709 --> 01:24:31,177
Stop it.

1073
01:25:37,343 --> 01:25:39,342
<i>The world is changing.</i>

1074
01:25:39,344 --> 01:25:43,146
London must now look
beyond Municipal Darwinism

1075
01:25:43,148 --> 01:25:45,685
and move into a new age.

1076
01:25:52,357 --> 01:25:54,725
<i>Tonight, we set a course</i>

1077
01:25:54,727 --> 01:25:56,260
<i>for the savage heartland</i>

1078
01:25:56,262 --> 01:25:58,327
of the Anti-Traction League.

1079
01:25:58,329 --> 01:26:03,167
<i>The Shield Wall of Shan Guo
and the lands beyond</i>

1080
01:26:03,169 --> 01:26:05,234
<i>will become our new
hunting ground.</i>

1081
01:26:32,097 --> 01:26:34,363
<i>For centuries, Traction Cities</i>

1082
01:26:34,365 --> 01:26:36,300
<i>have attempted
to breach the wall.</i>

1083
01:26:36,302 --> 01:26:40,304
<i>Their rotting carcasses
lie at its base.</i>

1084
01:26:40,306 --> 01:26:43,340
<i>But that will not be our fate.</i>

1085
01:26:43,342 --> 01:26:46,076
<i>Tonight, London</i>

1086
01:26:46,078 --> 01:26:49,212
is going to demonstrate
its new power,

1087
01:26:49,214 --> 01:26:54,484
<i>a power that will sweep
all before it.</i>

1088
01:26:54,486 --> 01:26:58,020
<i>Tonight, we take the fight</i>

1089
01:26:58,022 --> 01:27:00,793
to Shan Guo.

1090
01:27:12,937 --> 01:27:14,771
Hold your formation

1091
01:27:14,773 --> 01:27:16,276
on approach, <i>Jenny Haniver.</i>

1092
01:27:17,375 --> 01:27:19,243
Welcome home, Windflower.

1093
01:27:19,245 --> 01:27:21,778
Windflower?

1094
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:26,116
I was once kept as a slave
on the Ice City of Arkangel.

1095
01:27:26,118 --> 01:27:31,555
I vowed never to be owned
by another again.

1096
01:27:31,557 --> 01:27:33,924
I made my friends
swear an oath.

1097
01:27:33,926 --> 01:27:36,460
"When this body is done,

1098
01:27:36,462 --> 01:27:39,395
"throw my ashes to the wind.

1099
01:27:39,397 --> 01:27:44,201
"I can face anything,
even death,

1100
01:27:44,203 --> 01:27:46,936
as long as my spirit is free."

1101
01:28:25,945 --> 01:28:28,311
The Allied Fleet,

1102
01:28:28,313 --> 01:28:30,883
the great defenders
of the East.

1103
01:28:51,070 --> 01:28:53,139
Governor Kwan is waiting.

1104
01:29:05,383 --> 01:29:07,384
London is fast approaching.

1105
01:29:07,386 --> 01:29:10,086
Governor...

1106
01:29:10,088 --> 01:29:11,889
launch the fleet.

1107
01:29:11,891 --> 01:29:14,190
- We cannot wait.
- What are you suggesting?

1108
01:29:14,192 --> 01:29:16,025
A preemptive strike?

1109
01:29:16,027 --> 01:29:18,127
Destroy Medusa
before it destroys us.

1110
01:29:18,129 --> 01:29:19,429
No, no, no.
You-you... you can't do that.

1111
01:29:19,431 --> 01:29:21,430
What choice do we have?

1112
01:29:21,432 --> 01:29:24,268
We didn't start this,
but we will finish it.

1113
01:29:24,270 --> 01:29:25,969
Hang on a minute, all right?

1114
01:29:25,971 --> 01:29:28,537
Listen to me.
There has to be another way.

1115
01:29:28,539 --> 01:29:30,439
There are thousands of
innocent people on that city.

1116
01:29:30,441 --> 01:29:32,408
They don't deserve to die.

1117
01:29:32,410 --> 01:29:34,978
No, they do not.

1118
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:38,015
Nor do we seek
to harm the innocent.

1119
01:29:38,017 --> 01:29:43,086
Understand, life is precious
to the Shan Guonese.

1120
01:29:43,088 --> 01:29:45,689
So believe me when I say this:

1121
01:29:45,691 --> 01:29:50,460
If there was another way,
I would take it.

1122
01:29:50,462 --> 01:29:52,930
No. It's my home.

1123
01:29:52,932 --> 01:29:54,934
Summon Fleet Command.

1124
01:30:01,507 --> 01:30:04,707
We strike first.

1125
01:30:07,212 --> 01:30:09,546
Tom.

1126
01:30:09,548 --> 01:30:11,982
What's happening?

1127
01:30:18,089 --> 01:30:20,025
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1128
01:30:30,969 --> 01:30:32,336
Entering enemy kill zone

1129
01:30:32,338 --> 01:30:34,738
in six minutes and 39 seconds.

1130
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:36,376
Raise it up.

1131
01:30:44,717 --> 01:30:47,016
We target the searchlights.

1132
01:30:47,018 --> 01:30:48,318
Take out
their forward defenses.

1133
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:49,452
London's gun turrets
are deadly.

1134
01:30:49,454 --> 01:30:51,020
Don't underestimate them.

1135
01:30:51,022 --> 01:30:52,622
We'll have to destroy

1136
01:30:52,624 --> 01:30:55,391
all fixed artillery
to access the cathedral.

1137
01:30:55,393 --> 01:30:58,431
Take them out.
Hit them hard and fast.

1138
01:31:00,531 --> 01:31:02,466
Get them into the air.

1139
01:31:02,468 --> 01:31:05,301
Now!

1140
01:31:20,651 --> 01:31:23,119
Tom!

1141
01:31:23,121 --> 01:31:25,657
Tom! Wait!

1142
01:31:50,281 --> 01:31:51,782
London!

1143
01:32:11,803 --> 01:32:14,738
What have they done?

1144
01:32:33,792 --> 01:32:37,493
- Confirm target coordinates.
- Coordinates confirmed.

1145
01:32:37,495 --> 01:32:39,431
Target is locked.

1146
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:45,103
<i>Aso luman sala ta.</i>

1147
01:32:46,237 --> 01:32:49,305
<i>Aso luman sala ta...</i>

1148
01:33:31,383 --> 01:33:32,752
Tom!

1149
01:33:41,627 --> 01:33:44,597
Initiate firing sequence.

1150
01:33:49,634 --> 01:33:51,236
Tom!

1151
01:33:52,437 --> 01:33:54,107
I have it.

1152
01:33:56,674 --> 01:33:58,610
Is that...?

1153
01:34:01,847 --> 01:34:04,780
Where did you get this?

1154
01:34:04,782 --> 01:34:06,151
Go dark.

1155
01:34:10,521 --> 01:34:12,190
They're preparing to fire.

1156
01:34:13,292 --> 01:34:14,457
Sound the alarm.

1157
01:34:14,459 --> 01:34:15,859
Everybody off the wall!

1158
01:34:15,861 --> 01:34:17,560
Run!

1159
01:34:17,562 --> 01:34:19,528
Get inside now!

1160
01:34:21,532 --> 01:34:23,302
We need to find Anna.

1161
01:34:29,975 --> 01:34:31,474
Now, Twix.

1162
01:35:40,478 --> 01:35:42,878
London! London! London!

1163
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:46,252
London! London! London! London!

1164
01:35:56,561 --> 01:35:59,496
- Hit them again.
- Recharging accumulators.

1165
01:35:59,498 --> 01:36:01,497
They're coming through!

1166
01:36:05,771 --> 01:36:06,706
Anna!

1167
01:36:08,839 --> 01:36:10,806
- We have to get to London!
- Are you crazy?!

1168
01:36:10,808 --> 01:36:12,609
They're gonna fire
that weapon again!

1169
01:36:12,611 --> 01:36:14,943
Not if we shut it down.

1170
01:36:14,945 --> 01:36:17,479
The crash drive.

1171
01:36:17,481 --> 01:36:18,515
My mother gave it to me.

1172
01:36:18,517 --> 01:36:19,616
Come on, we have to go.

1173
01:36:19,618 --> 01:36:21,454
They destroyed
the Allied Fleet.

1174
01:36:23,989 --> 01:36:25,988
They didn't destroy us.

1175
01:36:27,859 --> 01:36:29,792
Nils, you lead.

1176
01:36:29,794 --> 01:36:31,493
Yasmina, stay on his wing.

1177
01:36:31,495 --> 01:36:32,530
Khora.

1178
01:36:37,369 --> 01:36:38,935
We're gonna be
under heavy fire.

1179
01:36:38,937 --> 01:36:41,738
I'll need you
to clear a path for me.

1180
01:36:41,740 --> 01:36:43,876
- Anna.
- Go.

1181
01:36:55,820 --> 01:36:57,554
Where's Tom?

1182
01:36:57,556 --> 01:36:58,758
Tom?

1183
01:37:13,605 --> 01:37:15,407
Tom?

1184
01:37:21,545 --> 01:37:23,747
You sure you want to do this?

1185
01:37:23,749 --> 01:37:26,783
Once we go in,
there's no going back.

1186
01:37:26,785 --> 01:37:27,753
I have to.

1187
01:37:28,919 --> 01:37:30,519
For my mom.

1188
01:37:30,521 --> 01:37:32,757
For Pandora.

1189
01:37:34,493 --> 01:37:36,126
Let's go.

1190
01:38:22,874 --> 01:38:24,607
They're gonna fire again!

1191
01:38:24,609 --> 01:38:27,010
Pull up! Pull up!

1192
01:38:40,792 --> 01:38:42,527
Recharge!

1193
01:39:05,115 --> 01:39:06,748
Khora.

1194
01:39:10,254 --> 01:39:12,555
Khora!

1195
01:39:29,206 --> 01:39:31,774
Stay low, Windflower.

1196
01:39:31,776 --> 01:39:33,275
We'll draw their fire.

1197
01:39:33,277 --> 01:39:35,010
Let's do this!

1198
01:39:35,012 --> 01:39:36,645
<i>Kaza wo bu yagen!</i>

1199
01:40:21,860 --> 01:40:23,062
Anna, leave it to me.

1200
01:40:27,298 --> 01:40:29,200
Nils, watch out!

1201
01:40:32,904 --> 01:40:34,240
Nils! No!

1202
01:40:44,014 --> 01:40:46,252
Toa, cover Yasmina!

1203
01:41:11,642 --> 01:41:13,177
I got this one.

1204
01:41:34,898 --> 01:41:37,669
We're hit, Anna! We're hit!

1205
01:41:43,674 --> 01:41:45,942
Yasmina, take out the last one!

1206
01:41:47,344 --> 01:41:49,682
We're going down! Hang on!

1207
01:42:14,673 --> 01:42:15,837
Toa!

1208
01:42:15,839 --> 01:42:16,973
Toa, come on.

1209
01:42:16,975 --> 01:42:18,774
Come on. Come on, get up.

1210
01:42:20,344 --> 01:42:22,912
Hey, get up.

1211
01:42:22,914 --> 01:42:24,913
Okay.

1212
01:42:37,795 --> 01:42:39,961
Hester!

1213
01:42:39,963 --> 01:42:41,898
Take this,
and stay out of sight

1214
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:44,000
- until I give you the signal.
- What signal?

1215
01:42:44,002 --> 01:42:47,002
- How will I know?
- Trust me, you'll know.

1216
01:42:47,004 --> 01:42:49,007
I'm not that subtle.

1217
01:43:09,326 --> 01:43:11,327
Warning.

1218
01:43:11,329 --> 01:43:13,162
Core temperature rising.

1219
01:43:13,164 --> 01:43:16,435
Increase the coolant!
Recharge!

1220
01:43:21,138 --> 01:43:22,273
Over there!

1221
01:43:36,187 --> 01:43:38,019
Okay, city boy,
take her from here.

1222
01:43:38,021 --> 01:43:40,155
- What?
- I got to go.

1223
01:43:40,157 --> 01:43:41,293
I'm late for church.

1224
01:43:48,199 --> 01:43:49,998
Hey.

1225
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,804
Look after her.

1226
01:44:04,414 --> 01:44:07,015
Lock target coordinates.

1227
01:44:07,017 --> 01:44:08,917
Target is locked.

1228
01:44:08,919 --> 01:44:11,420
Wait!
Temperatures have to stabilize.

1229
01:44:11,422 --> 01:44:12,788
Prepare to fire.

1230
01:44:12,790 --> 01:44:14,457
Firing sequence initiated.

1231
01:44:14,459 --> 01:44:16,395
Do it, Twix!

1232
01:44:20,865 --> 01:44:21,800
Watch out!

1233
01:44:33,343 --> 01:44:35,545
Warning.

1234
01:44:35,547 --> 01:44:38,346
Core temperature critical.

1235
01:44:38,348 --> 01:44:40,049
Deploy system override.

1236
01:44:40,051 --> 01:44:42,754
Fire again! One more strike,
that wall comes down.

1237
01:44:48,526 --> 01:44:51,260
Take cover!

1238
01:45:02,106 --> 01:45:04,407
System override initiated.

1239
01:45:04,409 --> 01:45:08,176
Firing will commence
in 59 seconds.

1240
01:45:28,066 --> 01:45:29,535
She's gonna blow!

1241
01:45:37,275 --> 01:45:40,279
Firing will commence
in 45 seconds.

1242
01:46:12,410 --> 01:46:15,010
Firing will commence
in 30 seconds.

1243
01:46:15,012 --> 01:46:16,314
Come on, come on.

1244
01:46:33,063 --> 01:46:37,235
Firing will commence
in 15 seconds.

1245
01:46:42,039 --> 01:46:44,273
Ten. Nine.

1246
01:46:44,275 --> 01:46:45,440
- Come on.
- Eight.

1247
01:46:45,442 --> 01:46:48,344
- Come on. Come on, come on.
- Seven. -

1248
01:46:48,346 --> 01:46:50,179
- Six.
- Just let go.

1249
01:46:50,181 --> 01:46:52,381
Five. Four.

1250
01:46:52,383 --> 01:46:53,716
It's over.

1251
01:46:53,718 --> 01:46:55,717
- Three. Two.
- Not yet.

1252
01:46:55,719 --> 01:46:57,086
Come on.

1253
01:46:57,088 --> 01:46:59,521
One.

1254
01:47:03,962 --> 01:47:06,665
Firing sequence terminated.

1255
01:47:16,106 --> 01:47:17,405
Go.

1256
01:47:25,316 --> 01:47:27,550
System overload. Unstable.

1257
01:47:27,552 --> 01:47:29,351
Unstable.

1258
01:47:29,353 --> 01:47:31,522
Now it's over.

1259
01:48:19,771 --> 01:48:21,403
Kate.

1260
01:48:21,405 --> 01:48:22,771
Thank God you're safe.

1261
01:48:22,773 --> 01:48:26,641
- We need to go.
- How could you?

1262
01:48:26,643 --> 01:48:30,046
How many lives have you taken?

1263
01:48:30,048 --> 01:48:32,047
And for what?

1264
01:48:32,049 --> 01:48:34,750
I did what I had to.
This city was dying.

1265
01:48:34,752 --> 01:48:37,252
- I tried to save it.
- Stop lying to me.

1266
01:48:37,254 --> 01:48:39,587
You didn't do this
for any noble cause.

1267
01:48:39,589 --> 01:48:41,823
You did it for yourself,
for the power that it gave you.

1268
01:48:41,825 --> 01:48:42,824
That's not true.

1269
01:48:42,826 --> 01:48:44,827
Kate, we have to go.

1270
01:48:44,829 --> 01:48:46,228
We have to go now.

1271
01:48:46,230 --> 01:48:48,329
Trust me as you once did.

1272
01:48:48,331 --> 01:48:50,166
I can save us both.

1273
01:48:50,168 --> 01:48:53,335
Save us from what?

1274
01:48:53,337 --> 01:48:56,639
The weapon's destroyed.
The wall is still standing.

1275
01:48:56,641 --> 01:49:00,208
- You've failed.
- Failed?

1276
01:49:00,210 --> 01:49:03,481
You really don't know me,
do you?

1277
01:49:05,549 --> 01:49:07,785
That wall is coming down.

1278
01:49:13,025 --> 01:49:15,390
- What have you done?
- Don't go up there.

1279
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:18,159
Katherine!

1280
01:49:47,525 --> 01:49:50,462
- Let's go, Gench!
- Roger that.

1281
01:49:56,601 --> 01:49:57,835
<i>We must be tethered, boss!</i>

1282
01:50:06,878 --> 01:50:08,610
Come in, London Wheelhouse!

1283
01:50:08,612 --> 01:50:10,712
London Wheelhouse,
do you read me?

1284
01:50:10,714 --> 01:50:13,349
<i>Come in, London Wheelhouse!</i>

1285
01:50:13,351 --> 01:50:14,649
Tom?

1286
01:50:14,651 --> 01:50:16,652
- Tom, is that you?
- Katherine?

1287
01:50:16,654 --> 01:50:18,887
What the hell's going on
down there?

1288
01:50:18,889 --> 01:50:20,389
We're on a collision course.

1289
01:50:20,391 --> 01:50:21,724
He's driving the city
into the wall.

1290
01:50:21,726 --> 01:50:23,759
The brakes are gone.
They're dead.

1291
01:50:23,761 --> 01:50:25,894
You're gonna have to cut
London's engines.

1292
01:50:25,896 --> 01:50:28,430
I can't.
The controls are shot to hell.

1293
01:50:36,307 --> 01:50:37,872
Katherine, I need you
to do something.

1294
01:50:37,874 --> 01:50:39,243
Are you listening?

1295
01:50:47,951 --> 01:50:50,588
You're not going anywhere.

1296
01:50:54,225 --> 01:50:58,730
You're not gonna hurt
anyone else ever again.

1297
01:51:06,771 --> 01:51:08,503
Tom, are you sure about this?

1298
01:51:08,505 --> 01:51:10,174
Do it!

1299
01:51:19,816 --> 01:51:22,384
I will kill you.

1300
01:51:22,386 --> 01:51:24,485
I know you will.

1301
01:51:24,487 --> 01:51:26,889
Whatever the world
throws at you,

1302
01:51:26,891 --> 01:51:29,625
you fight it,
claw your way back.

1303
01:51:29,627 --> 01:51:31,894
You don't give up.

1304
01:51:31,896 --> 01:51:34,699
You are so like me.

1305
01:51:36,866 --> 01:51:39,870
Your mother never told you,
did she?

1306
01:51:43,708 --> 01:51:48,676
But then, I guess she
didn't need to, because...

1307
01:51:48,678 --> 01:51:50,949
you already knew.

1308
01:51:53,851 --> 01:51:56,688
Hester.

1309
01:52:04,895 --> 01:52:06,764
You let your guard down.

1310
01:53:40,857 --> 01:53:43,826
Is this what you want?
You want to die?

1311
01:53:43,828 --> 01:53:46,464
Come on, let's finish it.

1312
01:53:48,566 --> 01:53:50,402
No.

1313
01:53:58,142 --> 01:54:00,312
I'm gonna live.

1314
01:54:09,820 --> 01:54:12,324
Hold on!

1315
01:54:13,857 --> 01:54:15,560
Come on.

1316
01:54:21,065 --> 01:54:22,634
You're history.

1317
01:54:38,481 --> 01:54:39,750
Gench!

1318
01:57:32,789 --> 01:57:34,725
So, what happens now?

1319
01:57:36,192 --> 01:57:39,661
We go where the wind takes us.

1320
01:57:39,663 --> 01:57:41,363
See the world.

1321
01:57:41,365 --> 01:57:43,535
What do you say?

1322
01:57:48,871 --> 01:57:50,842
I'm coming with you.

1323
01:58:33,859 --> 01:58:38,859
